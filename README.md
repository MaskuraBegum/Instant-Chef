As a Backend Developer for Instant Chef, I built the backend using Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB, implementing ingredient matching algorithms and integrating Firebase Admin Authentication for Admin CRUD operation. I developed APIs for managing recipes and interacting with the AI assistant, Juniper, and enabled admin features for recipe management.
